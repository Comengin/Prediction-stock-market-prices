Prediction stock market prices using python
Data on the worth of stock prices for five firms, including Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla, is being compiled into a csv file. This was accomplished through the application of LSTM algorithms and Deep Learning technology. Data from the previous days was gathered, and the algorithm should forecast the price for the following 60 days. Dash plotly, a Python framework, was used to display the data obtained.
